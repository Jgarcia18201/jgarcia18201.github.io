									<h2><a href="#">My Portfolio</a></h2>
									<p>Welcome to my portfolio website. Where I showcase some of my projects and competencies as a game and software developer. 
										I am a computer science major, specifically focused in the software development aspect of the study. 
										I also have an AA in creative writing and a BA in English. I am experienced in story creation and scriptwriting.
										I am always striving to learn and am passionate about technology. 
									</p>

									<p>This is an ongoing project that I have been working on during my freetime. It is a Metroidvania style 2D platformer set in a
										cyberpunk world. I have developed scripts for the main player and some basic enemies.

										<h2><a href="#">Speedy Delivery
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/SpeedyDelivery.PNG" alt="" ></a>
									<p>This is a fun little project I undertook where I wanted to create a sort of pizza delivery game. This reminds me of an old arcade
										game that I really enjoyed called Crazy Taxi. This is different in that it is a top down view, similar to that of the early GTA
										titles. I learned a lot during this and I would like to continue to work on it.

										<h2><a href="#">Obstacle Course
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ObsCourse.PNG" alt="" ></a>
									<p>There is a lot going on in this game. I appreciate the chaos and really like that there was so much to mess around with. There are 
										falling objects, spinning objects, bouncing balls, and stationary blocks. The player is simply required to make it from one end of 
										the maze to the other. There is a debug.log in place to ensure that collisions are recognized and counted. I especially liked this 
										project because it makes great use of the different shapes that are standard in Unity.

										<h2><a href="#">Rocket Boost
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/RocketBoost.PNG" alt="" ></a>
									<p>This project allowed me to experiment with other forms of inputs. I set it up so that space bar would work as a thrust for the 
										rocket, and that the A and D keys would control the rotation of the rocket. In this project, I also got to create a number of 
										different levels, and I was able to use methods to transition between each level. I also added a feature so that the same level 
										would be reloaded in the case of failure. Overall, a really enjoyable experience.

										<h2><a href="#">C# Player's Guide
											Part One Boss Battle
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/BossBattle.PNG" alt="" ></a>
									<p>In this project, I have created a console application that is part of a book I've been reading called "The C# Player's Guide" by
										RB Whitaker. The game involves one player entering a number between 0 and 100, and another player guesses the number with a few 
										additions as well, such as health, loss of health, and round count.
